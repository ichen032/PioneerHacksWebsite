    <h1>Vet Hospitals</h1>
    <p>Not a lot veterinarians can treat exotic animals such as birds, so be sure to find a vet hospital nearby that does before getting your pet! It is beneficial to have annual checkups, but when you notice that your bird has symptoms such as staggering, off-balance walking, tilting head, convulsions, seizures, falling off perches, and labored breathing, they require treatment immediately.</p>
