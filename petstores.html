       <h1>Pet Stores - Bird Brain<h1>
    </div>
    <p>Before you decide to buy from pet stores, consider this:</p>
    <p>Pet stores often get their pets from breeders that inflict animal cruelty in their breeding operations. For example, puppy mills keep hundreds of puppies in small, stacked wire cages without veterinary care and exercise for long periods of time. They are then loaded onto trucks with the risk of being exposed to other sick animals to be shipped across the country. Dogs are not the only animals that suffer. In order to meet the huge demand of the pet trade, animals are bred and raised in inhumane conditions. Even if there are responsible breeders out there, buying from them still contributes to the animal overpopulation crisis. Instead of buying pets from pet stores, consider adopting animals from shelters.</p>
